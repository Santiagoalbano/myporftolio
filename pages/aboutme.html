<p class="intro2">As a web developer with a passion for graphic design and fluency in Spanish, English, and intermediate Italian,<br>
   I bring a unique perspective to my work. With a strong eye for detail and a commitment to delivering high-quality projects,<br>
    I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.
  <br>
  <br>
    My love for web development began at a young age and has only grown stronger over time. <br>
    Through years of practice and dedication, I have honed my skills in various programming languages and frameworks,<br>
     allowing me to tackle complex projects with ease.<br>
      At the same time, I have also developed a keen sense of design,<br>
       which has helped me create visually stunning websites and applications that truly stand out.

  <div class="crit">
  <p class="intro2">Due to my age and just taking a look to my job, all of it it's freelance,<br>
     because I've never had the opportunity to work with a company or a large team of people.<br>
     <br>
    There are certain things I still have to improve and obviously more to learn and grow<br>
    Apart from that, there is a lot of things I'm still learning because right now my goal is to become a Full stack developer.<br> 
    My interests for the future are, Motion graphics, animations, 3D modeling and everything related to creative engineering.<br>
